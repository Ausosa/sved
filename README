SVED requires gVim (for the dbus support) and Evince version 3.0 or later.
Place the plugin in ~/.vim/ftplugin/
and create a binding to do forward syncronization:
nmap <F4> :call EVS_Sync()<CR>

The plugin searches for a file called *.latexmain in order to do forward
synchronization. If your main file of the latex project is called main.tex,
create an empty file called main.tex.latexmain and compile the project with:
pdflatex --synctex=1 main.tex
Then forward synchronization should work.
